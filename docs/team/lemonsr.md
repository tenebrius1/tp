### Project: CLITutors

### Overview

`CliTutors` is a desktop app for **managing private tutoring jobs**, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a private tuition agency with a **big list of tutors to manage**, `CliTutors` can help you to manage matching tutors and students for private tuition faster than using a regular database.
