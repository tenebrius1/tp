### Project: CLITutors

`CliTutors` is a desktop app for **managing private tutoring jobs**, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a private tuition agency with a **big list of tutors to manage**, `CliTutors` can help you to manage matching tutors and students for private tuition faster than using a regular database.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter tutors after matching to a specific student.
  * What it does: allows the user to filter the list of matched tutors based on certain parameters.  
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to filter out tutors based on specifications by the student.

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=knotstoks&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
