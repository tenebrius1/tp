**`CLITutors`** is a desktop app for **managing private tutoring jobs**, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you have a big list of tutors to manage, `CLITutors` helps you to manage matching tutors and students for private tuition faster than using a regular database.
